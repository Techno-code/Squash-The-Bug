# Squash-The-Bug
GameJamItch
My first ever game jam! It is Game Off 2021 and I am going to use pygame to create one, hopefully I can finish it in time. The theme is: BUG

Ideas:

Putting a bug on a car then following it, with a game like that
Smashing bugs and killing them (X)
You have to find the bug in a code
You are a bug trying to avoid getting hit by a swatter (X)
Clicker Game about ants
Ants want to eat you, dodge them! (X)
Polishing the ideas I like more:

For putting a bug on a car, I was thinking more story element, learning about the world, and forgetting you are trying to follow someone because you hate them, you have little mini-games ( This I can work on as my passion project later on, for now, not for game jam. Requires more art)
There are different levels where you have to find a bug in the game. There is some code presented and you have to click on the bugged part and fix the problem
Inspired from cookie game, you are a queen and when you click the queen, she gives birth to an ant. Then there are upgrades you can buy to continue ant production, goal of reaching 6 billion ants.
FINAL IDEA: Squashing The Bug

Basically, there are ten levels (more or less), and you have to find the bug in each level. Each code has a goal, and some bugs prevent it. In order to change it, you have to click on a box or reorder code to make sure they work and achieve the goal
